This project is to learn Spark trips and tricks.

Mostly it uses scala, spark RDDs, Spark SQl and integration with Kafka as source for spark

Under src/main, there's several folders of interest:
* jupyterNotebook - those are notebooks for Jupyuter to try some things directly on a jupyter notebook.
* scala - is the actual spark code (scala classes)
* sql - has some SQL for testing functionality in SQL.
